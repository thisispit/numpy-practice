# 🧮 NumPy Practice

Welcome to my personal NumPy learning repository!

This repository contains hands-on examples, practice scripts, and notes as I explore and master the fundamentals and advanced features of **NumPy** — the core library for numerical computing in Python.

3.  **Activate the Environment:**
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install NumPy:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

5.  **Run the Files:** Explore the `.py` files in each topic directory.

6.  **Deactivate the Environment:**
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
